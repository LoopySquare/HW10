## Installation
### In order to run this application, you will need to have Node and the Inquirer package installed on your computer. Node can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once Node is installed, you can install Inquirer by opening an integrated terminal and typing " npm i ". For more information on Inquirer, click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The Jest package is not required for the app to function, but it is required for the tests ran against this application. If you have already ran a "npm i" then jest is installed. For more information on Jest, click [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).
